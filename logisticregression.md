Description: Presentation outlining the utility and effectiveness of logistic regression on data analysis and statistical inference. Providing examples applying logistic regression on multiple datasets.


Outline:
1. Understanding Regression:

The earliest statistical tool taught to many students that begins to open a world of powerful modern tools with the help of computers is Linear Regression. With a sufficient and reliable foundation of data, linear model can be generated to interpolate and more importantly extrapolate values to predict useful information. There is a family of regression tools to unlock such as quadratic, polynomial, and other classification of nonlinear functions that are built from the same foundation of Linear Regresssion. Despite sharing the 'regression' in its name Logistic Regression is quite different from the likes of Linear, Quadratic, and Polynomial Regression. The goal of these regression tools is to establish viable function that can reliably predict other data points of interest.  However, while the motivation is still maintained to use mathematical and statistics to construct a model that will help predict outputs, Logistic Regression will predict outcomes.  The difference being that outcomes will be categorical and binary.
