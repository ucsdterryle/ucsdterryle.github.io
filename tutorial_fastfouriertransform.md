This is a tutorial created from a neuroscience course assignment processing Electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from a CSV file. In order to make sense of this signal as a data set, we will be to process them as waves. Understanding that these signals are periodic and have unique characteristics allows us to explore the different signals embedded from the recordings.

This tutorial will be very technical not from a programming stand point but technical in regards to mathematics and science. Though most of the math and science mostly rely things many would ahve encountered in high school, there are some aspects of this tutorial that will be helped and touch upon more advanced concepts found in college Calculus and Neuroscience courses. These more advanced concepts won't prevent you from being able to complete this tutorial but rather will help give a clearer understanding of the overall tasks. 

This tutorial will also contain information on generating basic plots and statistics.
